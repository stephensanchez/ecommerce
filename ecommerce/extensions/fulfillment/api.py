""" Fulfillment API for processing orders

Common interface designed to allow the fulfillment of orders for any type of product introduced into our catalog.
Calls down to a common interface for fulfillment of each line of an order based on a product type to determine if we
can successfully fulfill the product. Success can be reported back based on each line item in the order.
